# Exploring-the-Impact-of-Parental-Education-and-Study-Time-on-Students-Academic-Performance

An inferential analysis on how a student's academic (study-time) and demographic (father's and mother's education level) (individually) factors affect their school performance. 

Research Question - How parental education and study time affects the academic performance of a student.
Hypothesis - “Students with higher parental education levels and more number of hours per week dedicated to studying have better academic performance, as measured by their final grade.”

This study involves descriptive analysis and several data visualization plots to elicit meaningful insights and patterns, followed by building the intuition and constructing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), based on which the aforementioned hypothesis would be tested (after controlling for appropriate variables). A simple linear regression model is fitted, and an in-depth analysis of p-value, significance of error, confidence interval, intercept value for each variable is conducted for checking the statistical significance, followed by interpreting the overall R^2 value of the model. The study concludes with Diagnostics and Model Evaluation.
